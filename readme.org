Doctor

An event driven db and plasma dashboard for the health and status of your work.

Primary api is something like ~(doctor/log {:log/subject "" :log/body})~.

Expects to be run locally on your machine.

Supports misc widgets in a clover-based dashboard.

Consumes clawe and ralphie as a clojure-backend, but also exposes an api for
writing metadata to a database.

Intended to support workflow while working on other tasks - marking rabbitholes
and decision points so that you can replay and reexamine them later.

Supports configuring health-checks and other automations for workflow problems.
